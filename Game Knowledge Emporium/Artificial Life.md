The field of Artificial Life (AL) studies \[models and simulations] of \[agents and complex systems].
### Models
- a domain and set of rules/equations describing a phenomenon
### Simulation
- using the AL-model to play out the phenomenon over time (epoch)
### Agents
- Can be an abstraction of living entities or bots

The goal of Artificial Life is to imitate and simulate real-life organisms and processes. Generally bottom-up; complex behavior should follow from a set of low-level rules.
