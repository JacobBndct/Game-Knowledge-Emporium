***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What are the challenges in my game?
- Are they too easy, too hard, or just right?
- Can my challenges accommodate a wide variety of skill levels?
- How does the level of challenge increase as the player succeeds?
- Is there enough variety in the challenges?
- What is the maximum level of challenges in my game?
