#### ***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Are my players here to be judged (skill), or to take risks (chance)?
- Skill tends to be more serious then chance: Is my game serious or casual?
- Are parts of my game tedious? If so, will adding elements of chance enliven them?
- Do parts of my game feel too random? If so, will replacing elements of chance with elements of skill and strategy make tnhe players fell more in control
