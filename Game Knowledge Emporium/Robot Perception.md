In the real world a robots perceives the environment (exteroception), and itself (proprioception).
## Sensor Terminology
- Active vs Passive
	- **Active** sensors emit a signal that interacts with the environment, and measures that interaction
	- **Passive** sensors measure physical properties of the environment, without direct interaction.
	- Active sensors emit energy whereas passive sensors do not.
- Simple vs Complex
	- **Simple** sensors provide (usually 1D) data that does not require further processing or interpretation to be useful to the robot
	- **complex** sensors provide (usually multidimensional) data that requires sophisticated processing to be useful to the robot
