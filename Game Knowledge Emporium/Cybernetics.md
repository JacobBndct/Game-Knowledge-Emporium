Pioneered in the 1940s by Norbert Wiener around the time of the second world war to better understand artificial and biological systems using methods of [[control theory]].

According to The Robotics Primer: 

	"The field of study was named cybernetics, and its proponents studied bio logical systems, from the level of neurons (nerve cells) to the level of behavior, and tried to implement similar principles in simple robots, using methods from control theory. Thus, cybernetics was a study and comparison of communication and control processes in biological and artificial systems."

A key concept of cybernetics relevant to [[robots|robotics]] is the focus on the coupling, combining, and interaction between the mechanism or organism and its environment.

Cybernetics deals with "thinking", "acting", and the interaction with the environment.  When the fields of AI and Robotics would come to be the components of "thinking" and "acting" would be split with Robotics concentrating on acting and AI
