Pioneered in the 1940s by Norbert Wiener around the time of the second world war to better understand artificial and biological systems.

According to The Robotics Primer: "The field of study was named cybernetics, and its proponents studied bio logical systems, from the level of neurons (nerve cells) to the level of behavior, and tried to implement similar principles in simple robots, using methods from [[control theory]]. Thus, cybernetics was a study and comparison of communication and control processes in biological and artificial systems."

A key concept of cybernetics relevant to [[robots|robotics]] is the focus on the coupling, combining, and interaction between the mechanism or organism and its environment.
