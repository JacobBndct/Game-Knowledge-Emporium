"A robot is an *[[Autonomous Systems]]* which exists in the *physical* world, can *sense* it's environment, and can *act* on it to achieve some *goals*."

5 Different components that make something a robot are:
- Autonomous
- Physical
- Sense
- Act
- Goal

## Autonomy
Machines that are not autonomous, but are instead externally controlled by humans are called [[Teleoperated]].
## Embodiment 
To exist in the physical world, is to be embodied.
- Capable of maintaining itself in the outside world. 
- Adapting and reacting differently to changing environment which can include learning mechanisms.
## Sensing
To be situated in the physical world, is to be able to exist in and sense the world.
- Foregoes the necessity of acting
- Must sense the environment with its own sensors and cannot act without consideration for the environment
## Acting
