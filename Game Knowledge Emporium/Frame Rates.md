Frame rate is the measure of how often the screen is redrawn. As of writing this, most standard televisions refresh at a rate of 60 times per second.

Frame rates are also very important to animation. The standard for TV and movies is 24fps which is the minimum speed needed to capture video while maintaining realistic motion. Animating on 1's is when an animator draws a new frame for every frame, this is usually done for smoother more fluid motions. When an animator draws only one frame for every second frame, then it's called animating on 2's. This is often done to save on time and money and for less important shots animators sometimes even animate on 3's.

In video games frame rates may vary depending on the performance and optimizations of the game and may result in slowdown. Something worth noting is that players are far more perceptive to changes in frame rate rather then the actual frame rate itself. In Steve Swink's book "Game Feel" he states that in order to maintain a sense of [[Real-Time Control]], the game must deliver a new frame for every [[Perceptual Cycle]]. The average time it takes for humans to perceive something around 100ms so a game must update at or below that threshold in order to maintain real-time control.
