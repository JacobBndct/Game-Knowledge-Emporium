According to Steve Swink in his book Game Feel, there are three requirements that must be met for a game to have game feel:

1. [[Real-Time Control]]
2. [[Spatial Simulation]]
3. [[Polish]]

A workable definition for game feel given by Steve Swink is: 

"**Real-time control of virtual objects in a simulated space, with interactions emphasized by polish.**"
