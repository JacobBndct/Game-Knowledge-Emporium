"People may forget what you said, but they'll never forget how you made them feel" - Maya Angelou

***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What emotions would I like my player to experience? Why?
- What emotions are players (including me) having when they play now? Why?
- How can I bridge the gap between the emotions players are having and the emotions I'd like them to have?
