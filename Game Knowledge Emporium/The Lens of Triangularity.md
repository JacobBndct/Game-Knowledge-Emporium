Very closely related to [[Risk & Reward]]. Triangularity is giving the player choices between safe choices with small rewards, or risky choices with larger rewards.

***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Do I have triangularity now? If not, how can I get it?
- Is my attempt at triangularity balanced? That is, are the rewards commensurate with the risks?
