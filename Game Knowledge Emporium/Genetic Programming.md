Genetic Programming is a form of evolutionary computation in which the individuals in the evolving population are full **computer programs** rather than binary strings!

- It is an extension of [[Genetic Algorithms]]
- Has demonstrated to produce intriguing results:
	1. Design of electronic filter circuits
	2. Classification of segments of protein molecules

To do this we represent computer programs via a [[Tree]]:
- Each function call is represented by a node in the tree
- The arguments of the function are given by the descendant nodes

In Genetic Programming: 
1. We use the same genetic operators that define Genetic Algorithms
2. Howev
