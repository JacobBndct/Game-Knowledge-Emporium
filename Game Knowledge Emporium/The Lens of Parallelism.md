#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- Are there bottlenecks in my design where players are unable to proceed if they cannot solve a particular challenge? Could parallel challenges help?
- Are my parallel challenges different enough from each other to give players the benefit of variety?
- Can my parallel challenges be connected somehow? Is there a way that making progress on one can make it easier to solve the others?
