*If $X$ and $Y$ are finite sets then $\#(X \times Y) = \# X \# Y$.*

*Proof:* As a preparation we first prove a special case where $\# X = 1$. If the only element of $X$ is called $p$ then the projection then the projection $\pi _2 : X \times Y \rightarrow Y$ is invertible with $\pi _2 ^{-1} (y) = (p,y)$. This shows that $\# (X \times Y) = \# Y$.

Denote by $S_n$ the statement that the theorem is true when $\# X = n$. We will prove $S_n$ by induction. First when $n = 0$ then $X$ must be
