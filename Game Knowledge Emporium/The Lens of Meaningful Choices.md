***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What choices am I asking the players to make?
- Are they meaningful? How?
- Am I giving the player the right number of choices? Would more make them feel more powerful? Would fewer make the game clearer?
- Are there any dominant strategies in my game?
