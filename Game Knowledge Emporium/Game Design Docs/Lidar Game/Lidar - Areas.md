	- An interesting idea for being in the "lost state" where the player has gone off of the path might be that they can go to any other area from this state if they have the correct knowledge. In order to keep this mechanic interesting and avoid the player always using this, there might be addition risks the player takes on by being in the "lost state". This will give this area an interesting [[Risk & Reward]] factor.
