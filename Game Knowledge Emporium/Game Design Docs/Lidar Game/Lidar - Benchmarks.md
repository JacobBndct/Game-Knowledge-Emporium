### Curiosity Driven Gameplay

Knowledge as a reward for exploration and curiosity.

The main goals in Outer Wilds's design were to:

- Inspire curiosity
- Facilitate exploration
- Reward exploration

Outer Wilds uses a sprawling mystery composed of several smaller mysteries 

How do we get players to ask questions? -> What questions do we want the player to ask to guide the player's journey?

Show rather than tell is a much stronger motivator for these types of questions. In Outer Wilds they use big flashy events such as the Nomai statue at the start of the game and the Sun blowing up. Physical processes and locations grab the attention of the player and make them want to investigate. Big initial hooks for mysteries are mostly done with physical things.
