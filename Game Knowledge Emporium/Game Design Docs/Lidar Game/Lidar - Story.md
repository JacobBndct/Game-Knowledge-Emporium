The story starts by the player waking up in a very foggy area having fallen into a hole. There is the climbing equipment scattered around as the player wakes up. A strong beam of light comes down from above coming from a hole which the player has fallen from. There is evidence scattered around indicating that the player's companion has gone on ahead. There is a single path leading the player to an old house with an introduction character waiting for them.

The player has lost their "voice" or another aspect of themselves once they enter the world.

The player encounters several areas each encompassing a different aspect of themselves and their own self doubts. Each of these areas has a fairy tale like lesson and charm. Special items or information can also be acquired from interacting with these scenarios. Potential examples include:
- Falling behind others (Tortoise and the Hare)
- Feeling lesser than others
- Meeting expectations (Towering area which is unreachable)
- Pressure to do what others want from you (religion)
- Imposter syndrome 
- Isolation & desolation 
### Potential Endings
- The player accepts their fate and choses to stay in their new world.
- The player chooses to leave their friend behind and run away themselves.
- The player saves their friend and escapes back to the real world with them.
- Forsake the whole work for one person (3rd impact moment)
