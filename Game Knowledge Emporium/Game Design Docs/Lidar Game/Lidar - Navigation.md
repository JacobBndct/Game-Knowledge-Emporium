Navigation in this game can be thought of as some sort of [[Functions|function]] that maps the current area to a new set of areas that the player is able to visit from their current location. This might be implemented as a sort of [[State Machine Pattern|state machine]]. 

Here are some of the ways to guide the player to locations.
### Landmark
A large visual indication of a way in which the player can locate something.
### Deterrent
Something that makes taking a path more difficult. Examples of this might be darkness or some sort of threat.
### Road block
Something that makes taking a path completely impossible. The player may need to turn around and take a new path.
### The guide
Something or someone who the player can follow to get to a location.
### Directions
Players can ask NPCs for directions to a certain area or location they have already visited. The NPC may or may not know the way and may choose to mislead the player.
### Signposts 
A written indicator that is always true and that points the player to certain areas.
### Branching paths
A choice the player must make for where to go.
### Governing rules
The rules that are used when mixing up the paths. If the player understands these rules, they should be able to go anywhere they please.
