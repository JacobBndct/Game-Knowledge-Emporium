*Constraints?
Goals?
How do you use the tool?*

Tools can change the way the player perceives things and add more complexity by adding new ways to view a problem.
### Understanding others perspectives and how they experience the world
- View the world through the perspectives of other creatures. Come to understand how they see the world around them and why they behave in a certain way.
### Lidar Gun
- Light reflects off some objects?
- Lidar only regenerates energy when in light.
- As you scan it automatically maps out the area as a 3d map.
- Some sections of caves are “dead zones” and cannot connect to the mapping system for some reason (in separate dimension)
- Play sound depending on depth of each beam
- Encounter other “scanner” in the world that allow you to use your knowledge of them and learn from them
### Lamp
- Keep lamp lite in order to explore the world.
- When the lamp goes out, the player is in danger of being is reset back to the loop starting point.
- Some areas require the player to have a light level high or low enough.
### Grapple Hook
-   
### Traveling between dimensions
- Travel between realities to combine to interact with or combine things together.
- Perhaps you’re traveling more than just space when you swap universes, but also time?
- Your body can be in a different reality than the one you’re seeing.
- Picture the different realities as a graph of nodes.
