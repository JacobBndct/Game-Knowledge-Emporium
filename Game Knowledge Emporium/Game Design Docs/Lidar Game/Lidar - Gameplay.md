## Tools & Mechanics

Constraints?

Goals?

How do you use the tool?

Tools can change the way the player perceives things and add more complexity by adding new ways to view a problem.

### Understanding others perspectives and how they experience the world

- View the world through the perspectives of other creatures. Come to understand how they see the world around them and why they behave in a certain way.
    

### Lidar Gun

- Light reflects off some objects?
    
- Lidar only regenerates energy when in light.
    
- As you scan it automatically maps out the area as a 3d map.
    
- Some sections of caves are “dead zones” and cannot connect to the mapping system for some reason (in separate dimension)
    
- Play sound depending on depth of each beam
    
- Encounter other “scanner” in the world that allow you to use your knowledge of them and learn from them
    

### Grapple Hook

### Traveling between dimensions

- Travel between realities to combine to interact with or combine things together.

- Picture the different realities as a graph of nodes.
