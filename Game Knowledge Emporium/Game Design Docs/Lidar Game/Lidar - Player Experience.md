- People in this situation may feel
	- A lack of purpose
	- Unfulfilled  
	- Lost
	- Isolated
	- Unease & anxiety
	- Wanting to give up
	- They are losing time (it's important that the passage of time is clear to the player in this game)

- It's fine to fail
- Your life is your own
- The road not taken by Robert Frost
