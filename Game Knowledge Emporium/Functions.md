*A **function** $f$ from [[Sets|set]] $X$ to set $Y$ is a rule that assigns to each element of $X$ precisely one element of $Y$. Notation: $f:X \rightarrow Y$ *

**Identity function:** Maps a set to itself, for example the identity function of $A$ is $id_A : A -> A$

**Indicator functions:** for any subset A is a subset X of a set define a function where if x is contained by A it returns a 1 or a 0 if it is not contained

Two functions f : X -> Y and g : A -> B are equal iff X = A and Y = B and for every x e X, f(x) = g(x)

A function is invertible if there exists a function g : Y -> X such that *g* o *f* = identity of x and *f* o *g* = identity of y

Remark that sin^-1 is not a function on the reals and neither is sqt()
