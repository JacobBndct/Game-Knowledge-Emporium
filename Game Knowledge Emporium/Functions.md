For any two sets X and Y we can consider functions f : x -> y

Functions are rules that gives an element f(x) e Y for any x e X

Indicator functions: for any subset A is a subset X of a set define a function where if x is contained by A it returns a 1 or a 0 if it is not contained

Identity function: Maps a set to it's self, for example the identity function of A is id_A : A -> A

Two functions f : X -> Y and g : A -> B are equal iff X = A and Y = B and for every x e X, f(x) = g(x)

A function is invertible if there exists a function g : Y -> X such that *g* o *f* = identity of x and *f* o *g* = identity of y

Remark that sin^-1 is not a function on the reals and neither is sqt()
