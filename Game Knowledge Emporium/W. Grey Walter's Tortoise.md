The first ever [[Robots|robot]] by the definition contained in The Robotics Primer.

It was created by William Grey Walter who was a neurophysiologist interested in the way the brain works.

The Tortoises W. Grey Walter created are described in The Robot Primer as 

	"... simple robots built with three wheels in a tricycle-like design, using the front wheel for steering and the two back wheels for driving. They were covered with a clear plastic shell, giving them a life-like appearance, at least to a friendly and open-minded observer."

Using only these simple components the Tortoises could have the following behaviors:
- Find the light
- Head towards the light
- Back away from bright light
- Turn and push to avoid obstacles
- Recharge battery

The Tortoises were controlled by [[reactive control]]
