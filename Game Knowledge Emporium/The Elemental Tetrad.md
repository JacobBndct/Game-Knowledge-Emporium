The elemental tetrad are the core 4 elements that make up a game; 
- Aesthetics
- Technology
- Mechanics
- Story

***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Is my game using elements of all four types?
- Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?
- Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other and working together towards a common theme?
