Lemma 1.5: For all sets X we have {} as a subset of X

Proof by contradiction: 
Assume it is not true that {} is a subset of X. So there must be some g e {} such that g !e X/ But this is impossible because {} has no elements so we cannot find any such g e {}. Thus {} is a subset of X must be true :)
