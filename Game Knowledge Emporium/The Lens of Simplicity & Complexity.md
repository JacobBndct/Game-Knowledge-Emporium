***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What elements of innate complexity do I have in my game?
- Is there a way this innate complexity could be turned into emergent complexity?
- Do elements of emergent complexity arise from my game? If not, why not?
- Are there elements of my game that are too simple?
