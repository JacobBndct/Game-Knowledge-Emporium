*Consider the function $f: X \rightarrow Y$. For the function to be surjective, every $y \in Y \; \exists$ at least one $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Ever element in Y is "mapped to", which is why it is sometimes called "onto".*

If a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is surjective (or onto), then the [[Image and Range of Functions|image]] of $f$ is equal to the codomain $Y$.
