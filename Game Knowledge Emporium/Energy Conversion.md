One example of this conversion would be 
1. Chemical energy from gasoline is conversed 
2. Combusted into heat in the engine
3. Mechanical energy to the wheels and thereby to the whole car 
4. Through friction with road and air to heat.
## Conventional Energy Consumption
Direct use the heat of the combustion process such as domestic heating
## Indirect Energy Consumption
1. Internal
2. Thermal
3. Mechanical
4. Electrical
