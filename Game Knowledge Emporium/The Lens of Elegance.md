***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What are the elements of my game?
- What are the purposes of each element? Count these up to give the element an "elegance rating".
- For elements with only one or two purposes, can some of these be combined into each other, or be removed altogether?
- For elements with several purposes, is it possible for them to take on even more?
