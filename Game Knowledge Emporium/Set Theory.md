Counting collections of objects as sets and creating functions to describe the relations between sets is what set theory is all about. Functions are essential in showing how sets relate and make the theory of sets more powerful and expressive than mere arithmetic.

The motivation for Set Theory comes from Calculus. In calculus we have intervals like $[-\pi, \pi) = { x \epsilon \Bbb R : -\pi \le x \lt \pi }$

[[Sets]] -> [[Counting]] -> [[Numbers]]

In the table below various concepts from elementary counting and arithmetic are related to concepts in set theory. 

| Arithmetic | Set Theory |
| -----------| -----------|
| $0$ | $\emptyset$ |
| $a$ | Set $A$ with $a$ elements |
| $a = b$| Existence of an invertible function $f:A \rightarrow B$ |
| $a \le b$ | Existence of an injective function $f:A \rightarrow B$ |
| $a + b$ | Disjoint union: $A \cup B$, provided $A \cap B = \emptyset$ |
| $a -b$ | Set difference $A \setminus B$, provided $B \subseteq A$ |
| $a \times b$ | Cartesian product $A \times B$ |
| $2^a$ | Set of all subsets of $A$ ([[Power Set]] $2^A$) |
| $b^a$ | Set $B^A$ of all functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ |
| $a/r$ | set of equivalence classes $A \setminus B$ |
