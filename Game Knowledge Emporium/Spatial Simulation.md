One of the 3 requirements for [[Game Feel]] according to Steve Swink. 

Simulated space refers to the simulated physical interactions in virtual space, perceived actively by the player. These are things such as collision detection and other interactions between the player's avatar and the simulated virtual world. This creates a tactile, physical sense of interaction and allows for the player to use their avatar as a channel of expression and perception. In order for a game to have simulated space, the player must also be actively perceiving the space instead of passively observing it.
