What should the player be feeling?
What are the guiding principles behind the design of the game?

## Guiding Principle

Without truly understanding others' perspectives, we repeat the same mistakes over and over again. 

## Player Type

### Explorer

## Emotions

### Curiosity 

The main driving motivator for players in this game. Players should be driven to learn and explore because they are interested in learning more about the setting and mystery of the game.

### Wonder

Players should feel a sense of joy and wonder from discovering something new whether that be a new mechanic or place. Environment should be very important to the player. Channel the excitement of traveling.
