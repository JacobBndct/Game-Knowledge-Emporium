***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What skills does my game require from the player?
- Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?
- Which skills are dominant?
- Are these skills creating the experience I want?
- Are some players much better at these skills than others?
- Does this make the game feel unfair?
- Can players improve their skills with practice?
- Does this game demand the right level of skill?
