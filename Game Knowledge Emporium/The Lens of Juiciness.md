#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- Is my interface giving the player continuous feedback for their actions? If not, why not?
- Is second-order motion created by the actions of the player? Is this motion powerful and interesting?
- Juicy systems reward the player many ways at once. When I give the player a reward, how many ways am I simultaneously rewarding them? Can I find more ways?
