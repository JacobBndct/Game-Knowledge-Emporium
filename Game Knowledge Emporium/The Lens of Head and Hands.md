***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Are my players looking for mindless action, or an intellectual challenge?
- Would adding more places that involve puzzle solving in my game make it more interesting?
- Are there places where the player can relax their brain, and just play the game without thinking?
- Can I give the player a choice - either succeed by exercising a high level of dexterity, or by finding a clever strategy that works with a minimum of physical skills?
- If "1" means all physical, and "10" means all mental, what number would my game get?
