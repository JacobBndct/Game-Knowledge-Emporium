*Any subset of a finite set  is finite*.

*Proof:* Before attempting to prove the general case of a finite set we will assume that our finite set is one of the standard ones $[n]$. In this case it is more transparent to do induction so for any $n \in \Bbb N$ we introduce the following statement $S_n:$ $$\text{Any subset of } [n] \text{is finite} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; (S_n)$$
To proceed by induction we first need to demonstrate $S_0$ is true and second prove that $S_n$ implies $S_{n + 1}$
