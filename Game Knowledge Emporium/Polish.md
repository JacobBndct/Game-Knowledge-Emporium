One of the 3 requirements for [[Game Feel]] according to Steve Swink. 

Polish refers to additional effects that are used to enhance the interactions the player has in the simulated space without changing the underlying simulation itself. This could be things such as VFX or camera shake to give a few examples. Polish helps to "sell" the world by changing the way the player perceives it, but not effecting how it works.
