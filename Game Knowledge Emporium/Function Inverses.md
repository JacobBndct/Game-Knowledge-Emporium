Inverse of h o f = identity function of x
Inverse of f o h = identity function of y

Lemma: If h and k are both inverses of f, h: Y -> X, k: Y -> X and f: X -> Y. then h = k

Proof: To show that for all y e Y  h(y) = k(y). Shortcut: use properties of inverse.

h = h o identity of y = h o (f o k) = (h o f) o k = identity of x o k = k

thus h is equal to k.
