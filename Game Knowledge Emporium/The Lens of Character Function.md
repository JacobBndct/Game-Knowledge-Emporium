#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- What are the roles I need the characters to fill?
- What characters have I already imagined?
- Which characters map well to which roles?
- Can any characters fill more than one role?
- Do I need to change the characters to better fit the roles?
- Do I need any new characters?
