The places in which we play games is greatly important to how we experience them. For example, mobile games might be played in various environments and it is important that designers are aware of that when designing their games. 

***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What type of venue best suits the game I'm trying to create?
- Does my venue have special properties that will influence my game?
- What elements of my game are in harmony with my venue? What elements are not?
