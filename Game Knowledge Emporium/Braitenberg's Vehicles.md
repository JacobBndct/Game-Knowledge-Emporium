Braitenberg's Vehicles are described in Valentino Braitenberg's book "Vehicles" and are similar to [[W. Grey Walter's Tortoise]].  Braitenberg's Vehicles are important to the field of the field of robotics even if they were never actually built.

The vehicles are described in The Robotics Primer: 

	Braitenbergâ€™s vehicles started out with a single motor and a single light sensor, and gradually progressed to more motors and more sensors, and more interesting connections between them, all using analog electronic circuits. The sensors were directly connected to the motors, so that the sensory input could drivethemotoroutput. Forexample, alightsensorcouldbeconnected directly to the wheels, so the stronger the light, the faster the robot moved, as if it were attracted to the light
