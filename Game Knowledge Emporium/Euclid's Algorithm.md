*For integers $a,b$ with $(a,b) \not = (0,0)$ the following method computes $gcd(a,b)$:*
- *If one of $a$ or $b$ is zero, $gcd(a,b)$ equals the absolute value of the other one.*
- *If both are nonzero, replace them by their absolute value. Then replace the larger one by its remainder upon division by the smaller one. Repeat this until a situation is reached where one of the numbers equals 0, in which case the gcd equals the nonzero number.*

## Extension
Using what was learned from [[BÃ©zout's identity]] we can extend Euclid's Algorithm.

*For integers$a,b$ with the property $(a,b) \not = (0,0)$ the following method computes $g = gcd(a,b)$ as well as integers $x,y$ satisfying $ax+by=g:$*
- *Interchange $a,b$ if necessary, so that $|b| \le |a|$. *
- *If $b=0$ then $g = |a|$ and $a \; \cdot \; (\pm 1) + b \; \cdot \; 0 = g$ for a suitable choice of $\pm 1$.*
- *If $b \not = 0$ then write $|a| = q|b| + r$ for integers $q,r$ with $0 \le r \le |b| - 1$ and start from equalities $\{ \begin{aligned} (\pm1) \; \cdot \; a + 0 \; \cdot \; b = |a|,\\ 0 \; \cdot \; a + \; (\pm1) \; \cdot \; b = |b|.\end{aligned}$ Subtracting the second equality q times from the first yields a new pair $\{ \begin{aligned} 0 \; \cdot \; a + (\pm1) \; \cdot \; b = |b|,\\ (\pm1) \; \cdot \;a + \; (\pm q) \; \cdot \; b = r.\end{aligned}$ Repeatedly performing division with remainder to the two integers on the right-hand-side, and subtracting the lower equality a suitable number of times from the first, results on the right in a calculation of $g = gcd(a,b)$ while on the left the desired integers $x,y$ are obtained*
