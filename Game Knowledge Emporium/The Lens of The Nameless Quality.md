#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- Does my design have a special feeling of life, or do parts of my design feel dead? What would make my design more alive?
- Which of Alexander's fifteen qualities does my design have?
- Could it have more of them, somehow?
- Where does my design feel like myself?
