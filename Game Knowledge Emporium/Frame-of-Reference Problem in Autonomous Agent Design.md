The frame-of-reference problem concerns the
relation between the observer, the designer (or the modeler), the artifact, the environment, and the observed agent.

The frame-of-reference problem has three main aspects:

#### *Perspective issue:*
The perspective of an observer looking at the agent and the perspective of the agent itself are different. The behaviors that the observer perceives should not the taken as the internal mechanisms that dictate the behavior of the agent.

#### *Behavior-versus-mechanism issue:*
The behavior of an agent is always the result of a system-environment interaction and cannot be explained on the basis of internal mechanisms only.

#### *Complexity issue:* 
The complexity that is observed at the surface level by looking at the behavior of an agent is not necessarily indicative of the actual complexity of the mechanisms that guide it.
