***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What in my game is truly random? What parts just feel random?
- Does the randomness give the players positive feelings of excitement and challenge, or negative feelings of hopelessness and lack of control?
- Would changing my probability distribution curves improve my game?
- Do players have the opportunity to take interesting risks?
- What is the relationship between chance and skill in my game?
