Richard Dawkins came with the selfish gene hypothesis. This hypothesis says that basically the genes are alive and use the mortal individuals (e.g. us) as hosts so that they are able to propagate themselves further. Some genes may be found in many individuals whereas other genes are only found in a small subset of individuals. In this way, the genes seem to compete for hosts, and genes which occupy well performing individuals are likely to be able to reproduce themselves. The other way around we can say that genes which occupy well performing individuals give advantages for the individual and therefore it is good if they are allowed to reproduce.
