The field of *artificial intelligence (AI)* was officially "born" in 1956 when many prominent researches met at a conference to discuss creating intelligence in machines. Their conclusion was that in order of a machine to be "intelligent" it must use the following:

- Internal models of the world
- Search through possible solutions
- Planning and reasoning to solve problems
- Symbolic representation of information
- Hierarchical system organization
- Sequential program execution

One of the most well known algorithms in artificial intelligence are [[Genetic Algorithms]]. 

The goal of AI is to create intelligence of nay kind. Optionally it also borrows from real-life organisms and processes. It uses both bottom-up and top-down approaches.
