#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- How does each of my characters change throughout the game?
- How am I communicating those changes to the player? Can I communicate them more clearly, or more strongly?
- Is there enough change?
- Are the changes surprising and interesting?
- Are the changes believable?
