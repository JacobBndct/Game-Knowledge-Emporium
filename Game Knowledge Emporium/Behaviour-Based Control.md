## Think the way you act!!
- Biologically inspired
- Grew out of reactive control
- Deliberative systems are too slow
- Reactive systems are too inflexible and incapable of using internal representations, adaptation, or learning
- Hybrid systems require complex interaction among components
- Biology seem to have evolved complexity from simple and consistent components
- Tries to use the best aspects of reactive control, without using a hybrid solution
- It involves the use of behaviors as modules of control
- A BBC system is implemented as a collection of behaviours
## Behaviours
- more complex than actions
- achieve and/or maintain a goal
	- find-object, follow-target, get-recharged, find-human, ... 
- are not instantaneous, they take time.
- take inputs from sensors and from other behaviours
- send output to effectors and other behaviours
- Behaviours are typically executed in parallel as in a reactive system
- Networks of behaviours are used to store states and to cr
