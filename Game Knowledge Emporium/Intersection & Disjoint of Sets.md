*The **intersection** of two [[sets]] $X$ and $Y$ is the set whose [[Elements]] are precisely those that are both in $X$ and in $Y$. The commonly used notation for this $X \cap Y$. We say $X$ and $Y$ are **disjoint** iff $X \cap Y = \emptyset$.*

Intersection is about looking at what two sets have in common using the [[logical AND operator]].
### Properties of intersections
1. [[Associativity of intersections]]: ex. ($(X \cap Y) \cap Z = X \cap (Y \cap Z)$)
