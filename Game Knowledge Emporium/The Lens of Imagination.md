***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What must the player understand to play my game?
- Can some element of imagination help them understand that better?
- What high quality, realistic details can be provided in this game?
- What details would be low quality if we provided them? Can imagination fill the gap instead?
- Can I give details that the imagination will be able to reuse again and again?
