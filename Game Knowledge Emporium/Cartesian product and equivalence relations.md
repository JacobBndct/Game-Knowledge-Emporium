Definition: If X and Y are sets then X * Y is the set of all (ordered) pairs (x, y) where x e X, y e Y.  X * Y = {(x, y), x e X, y e Y}

Projection functions: PI: X * Y -> X is defined by PI((x, y)) = x and like wise PI2: X * Y -> Y

Goal: If X and Y are finite then #(X * Y) = (#X)(#Y)

also if X and Y are countably
