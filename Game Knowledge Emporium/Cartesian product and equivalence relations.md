Definition: If X and Y are sets then X * Y is the set of all (ordered) pairs (x, y) where x e X, y e Y.  X * Y = {(x, y), x e X, y e Y}

Projection functions: PI: X * Y -> X is defined by PI((x, y)) = x and like wise PI2: X * Y -> Y

Goal: If X and Y are finite then #(X * Y) = (#X)(#Y)

also if X and Y are countably infinite then so is X * Y

Lemma: If A, B, Y are sets then,
0. (A u B) * Y = (A * Y) u (B * Y)
1. Empty set = Empty set * Y = {(x, y) : y e Y, x e Empty set} 
2. (A n B) * Y = (A * Y) n (B * Y)

Proof of part 0 
To prove L = R where L = (A u B) * Y and R = (A * Y) u ()
