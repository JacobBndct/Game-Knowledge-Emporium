Stress and relief is a powerful tool for game designers. By stressing the player just the right amount and releasing the stress at the right moment, the player can get a sense of satisfaction. 

Whether it's an enemy, an obstacle, or a puzzle, all it has to do is impede the player's progress. By overcoming whatever is blocking them and releasing the stress, the player will feel great.

Giving a reward to the player for overcoming the stress can help make the player feel more accomplished and give them more confidence when facing stress in the future.
