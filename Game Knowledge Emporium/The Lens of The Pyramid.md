***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Is there a way all pieces of my puzzle can feed into a singular challenge at the end?
- Big pyramids are often made of little pyramids - can I have a hierarchy of ever more challenging puzzle elements, gradually leading to a final challenge?
- Is there challenge at the top of my pyramid interesting, compelling, and clear? Does it make people want to work in order to get to it?
