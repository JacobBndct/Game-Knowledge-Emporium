***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What does it mean to make progress in my game?
- Is there enough progress in my game? Is there a way I can add more interim steps of progressive success?
- What progress is visible, and what progress is hidden? Can I find a way to reveal what is hidden?
