#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- What aspects of my game will capture the interest of the player immediately?
- Does my game let the player see or do something they have never seen or done before?
- What base instincts does my game appeal to? Can it appeal to more of them?
- What higher instincts does my game appeal to? Can it appeal to more of those?
- Does dramatic change and anticipation of dramatic change happen in my game? How can it be more dramatic?
