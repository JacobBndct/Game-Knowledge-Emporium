Definition: An equivalence relation R on a set X is a subset relation R is a subset of X * X with the following properties. 

Using notation (x, y) e R will be written x ~ y
#### Properties
0. x ~ x (Reflexivity)
1. If x ~ y then y ~ x (Symmetry)
2. If x ~ y and y ~ z then x ~ z as well (Transitivity)
