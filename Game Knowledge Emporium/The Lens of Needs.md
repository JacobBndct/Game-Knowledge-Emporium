A player will only be able to focus on all aspects of your game if all of their needs are fulfilled in the game. An example of this is that the player can only start to focus on the story once they're understand how to progress it.

***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- On which levels of Maslow's hierarchy is my game operating?
- Does it fill the needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness?
- How can I make my game fulfill more basic needs than it already does?
- For the needs my game is already filling, how can it fill those needs even better?
