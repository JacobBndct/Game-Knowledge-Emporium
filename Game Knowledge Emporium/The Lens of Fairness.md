***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Should my game be symmetrical? Why?
- Should my game be asymmetrical? Why?
- Which is more important: that my game is a reliable measure of who has the most skill, or that it provides an interesting challenge to all players?
- If I want players of different skill levels to play together, what means will I use to make the game interesting and challenging for everyone?
