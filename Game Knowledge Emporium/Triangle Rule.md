The triangle rule is a rule that guided the terrain and environment design of Breath of the Wild. The triangle shape of the environment allowed decision making while exploring for the player who could choose to scale the environment or go around it. 

It also limits the objects of interest that the player can see and prevents them from getting overwhelmed. It also give a sense of [[Surprise]] as new objects of interest are revealed to the player as they scale or go around the triangle shaped environment.
