Risk and Reward is one of the most important aspects of game design. The concept is simple, take risks to get rewarded, but is also incredibly important. 

[[Strategy]] is how we manage risks & rewards. 

[[Balance]] is how the designer creates risk & reward. If a strategy has too much risk or too little risk for the rewards offered then this creates balance problems.
