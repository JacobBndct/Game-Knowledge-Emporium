*For any $a, b \in \Bbb Z$ with $(a,b) \not = (0,0)$ there exists $x,y \in \Bbb Z$ such that $gcd(a,b) = ax + by$*

$g = gcd(a,b)$ can be defined as the line $\ell$ on the $xy$-plane with the equation $ax + by = g$. BÃ©zout's identity asserts that the integers $x, y$ exist that satisfy the equation, and another way to phrase this, is to say that the line $\ell$ contain a point that has integers as coordinates.
