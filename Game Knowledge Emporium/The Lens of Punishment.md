***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What are the punishments in my game?
- Why am I punishing the players? What do I hope to achieve by it?
- Do my punishments seem fair to the players? Why or why not?
- Is there a way to turn these punishments into rewards and get the same, or better effects?
- Are my strong punishments balanced against commensurately strong rewards?
