According to The Robotics Primer "Control theory is the mathematical study of the properties of automated control systems ranging from steam engines to airplanes, and much in between."

Control theory's formalisms help understand fundamental concepts that are important to mechanical systems.

In the twentieth centaury control theory evolved a lot to be applied to many newly developed systems. This eventually lead to the application of classical mathematics, such as [[differential equations]], to the understanding of these new systems and gave birth to modern control theory.
