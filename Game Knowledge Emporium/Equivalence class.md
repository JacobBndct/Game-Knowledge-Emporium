Definition: The equivalence class of x e X is the set X^_ = { y e X: x ~ y } 

Also define X/R = set of all equivalence classes

Theorem: We say P is a subset of the powerset of X is  a partition of X if the union of all p = X with and for all p, q e P we have p n q = the empty set. If R is an equivalence relation on X then the set of equivalence classes X/R is a partition of X ***(This must be fixed)***

Proof:
To check, any element of x e X belongs to a unique element of X/R.
First x e x^_ because x ~ x
Second if x e z^_ and x e y^_ then x ~ y and x ~ z so y ~ z so x belongs to only one equivalence class.
