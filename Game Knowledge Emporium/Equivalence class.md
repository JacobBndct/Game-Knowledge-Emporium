*Given an equivalence relation $R$ on a set $X$ we say that the **equivalence class** of $x \in X$ is the set $\bar x = \{y \in X: y \sim x\}$.*

Also define $X \setminus R$ = set of all equivalence classes

Theorem: We say P is a subset of the powerset of X is  a partition of X if the union of all p = X with and for all p, q e P we have p n q = the empty set. If R is an equivalence relation on X then the set of equivalence classes X/R is a partition of X ***(This must be fixed)***

Proof:
To check, any element of x e X belongs to a unique element of X/R.
First x e x^_ because x ~ x
Second if x e z^_ and x e y^_ then x ~ y and x ~ z so y ~ z so x belongs to only one equivalence class.
