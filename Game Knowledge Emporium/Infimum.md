***Infimum***: greatest element in partially ordered set P which is less than or equal to each element of S which is a subset of P.

It is important to note that an infimum is not always a minimum, but a minimum is always a infimum.
## Definition:
$i \in \Bbb R$ is called the *greatest lower bound* of $A \subseteq \Bbb R$ if
- $i$ is a lower bound for $A$
- if $\ell$ is any lower bound for $A$ then $\ell \le i$
