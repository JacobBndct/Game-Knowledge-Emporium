Energy unit: "Joule"
Power unit: "Watt"

1 Joule of energy is delivering the power of 1 Watt during 1 second
1 kWh is 1 kW power during an hour

So 1 kWh = 1000 * 3600 Joule = 3.6 MJoule 
To support that, the electricity power plants have to combust about 2.5 times as much "primary energy", so 9 MJ.
