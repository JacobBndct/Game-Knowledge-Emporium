***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Is the space of this game discrete or continuous?
- How many dimensions does it have?
- What are the boundaries of the space?
- Are there sub-spaces? How are they connected?
- Is there more than one useful way to abstractly model the space of this game?
