*Imagine two sets $X$ and $Y$. We define $X$ is a **subset** of $Y$ iff every element of $X$ is also an element of $Y$. Notation: $X \subseteq Y$. Sometimes the notation $X \subset Y$ is also used with the understanding that in that case $X \not = Y$.*

There is strict inclusion between the common systems of numbers as follows:
$$\Bbb N \subset \Bbb$$
