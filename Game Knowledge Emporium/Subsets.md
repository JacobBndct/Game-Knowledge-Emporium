*Imagine two sets $X$ and $Y$. We define $X$ is a **subset** of $Y$ iff every element of $X$ is also an element of $Y$. Notation: $X \subseteq Y$. Sometimes the notation $X \subset Y$ is also used with the understanding that in that case $X \not = Y$.*

There is strict inclusion between the common systems of numbers as follows:
$$\Bbb N \subset \Bbb Z \subset \Bbb Q \subset \Bbb R \subset \Bbb C$$
### Subset notation

*Image a set $X$ and let us write down a statement $P(x)$ for each element $x$ of $X$. The following notation is used for the subset of all $x$ of $X$ for which $P(x)$ is true.* $$\{x \in X: P(x)\}$$
