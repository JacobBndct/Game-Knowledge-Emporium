#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- What does the player pick up and touch? Can this be made more pleasing?
- How does this map the actions in the game world? Can the mapping be more direct?
- If I can't create a custom physical interface, what metaphor am I using when I map the inputs to the game world?
- How does the physical interface look under [[The Lens of The Toy]]?
- How does the player see, hear and touch the world of the game? Is there a way to include a physical output device that will make the world become more real in the player's imagination?
