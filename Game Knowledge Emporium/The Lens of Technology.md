#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- What technologies will help deliver the experience I want to create?
- Am I using these technologies in ways that are foundational or decorational?
- If I'm not using them foundationally, should I be using them at all?
- Is this technology as cool as I think it is?
- Is there a "disruptive technology" I should consider instead?
