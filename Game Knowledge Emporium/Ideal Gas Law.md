The *ideal gas law*, also called the Boyle-Gay-Lussac law, is an approximation for a hypothetical "[[ideal gas]]". It works as a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. 
### $$pV = nRT$$
$R$ is the gas constant, $R =8.31$ J/(K.mol) and $n$ is the number of moles.
