The relationships between your characters can be understood by creating a graph with one axis labeled hostile/dominant. Pick a character, put it in the middle, and plot out where other characters lie relative to that character.
#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- Are there any gaps in the chart? Why are they there? Would it be better if they were filled?
- Are there "extreme characters" on the graph? If not, would it be better if there were?
- Are the character's friends in the same quadrant, or different quadrants? What if that were different?
