Learning is done from the inputs alone

Usually similarity or a distance measure is optimized

Clustering
- grouping similar data together
- A teacher (label) is not necessary
- Still hyperparameters to tune (k-means)

More definitions
- parameters: the trainable weights of the neural network
- hyperparameters:

#### Example: Autoencoding

Reducing the dimensionality of data

By learning to compress the (encode) a smaller latent representation and decompress from (decode) a smaller latent representation
