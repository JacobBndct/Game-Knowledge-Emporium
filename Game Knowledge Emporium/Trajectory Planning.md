[[Locomotion]] can be used for getting to a particular location or following a particular path/trajectory. Getting somewhere given a certain path is harder than getting there using any possible path.

Why follow a specific path?
- Safety
- Time limit
- Task requirement

The process of search for a satisfactory path is called *trajectory planning* or motion planning.

Finding the optimal trajectory depends on:
- Task (shortest, safest, fewest bumps)
- environment
- physical robot constraint
	- robot's body
	- steering mechanism (holonomic properties)
