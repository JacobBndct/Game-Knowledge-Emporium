The eight filters is a way to assess if your design is complete. A design is only complete when it can pass through all eight filters without needing to be changed.

***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Does this game feel right?
- Will the intended audience like this game enough?
- Is this a well-designed game?
- Is this game novel enough?
- Will this game sell?
- Is it technically possible to build this game?
- Does this game meet our social and community goals?
- Do the play tester enjoy this enough?
