***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Cooperation requires communication. Do my players have enough opportunity to communicate? How could communication be enhanced?
- Are my players friends already, or are they strangers? If they are strangers, can I help them break the ice?
- Is there synergy (2 + 2 = 5) or antergy (2 + 2 = 3) when players work together? Why?
- Do all players have the same role, or do they have special jobs?
