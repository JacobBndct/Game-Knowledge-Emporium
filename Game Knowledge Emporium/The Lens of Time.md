***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What is it that determines the length of my gameplay activities?
- Are my players frustrated because the game ends too early, or bored because the game is too long?
- Setting a time limit can make gameplay more exciting. Is it a good idea for my game?
- Would a hierarchy of time structures help my game?
