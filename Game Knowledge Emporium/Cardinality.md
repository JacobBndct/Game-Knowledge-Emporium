*Two sets $X$ and $Y$ have the same **cardinality** iff there us an [[function inverses|invertible function]] $f: X \rightarrow Y$.* 

$X$ is finite if there is some $n \in \Bbb N$ such that $[n]$ has the same cardinality as $X$. This means there is an invertible $\alpha : [n] \rightarrow X$.

Remark that both the set $\Bbb N$ and $\Bbb Z$ have the *same* cardinality because we can find an invertible function $h: \Bbb N \rightarrow \Bbb Z$. Intuitively this means that $\Bbb N$ and $\Bbb Z$ are "equally infinite".
