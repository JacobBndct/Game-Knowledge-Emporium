*Two sets $X$ and $Y$ have the same **cardinality** iff there us an [[function inverses|invertible function]] $f: X \rightarrow Y$.* 

$X$ is finite if there is some $n \in \Bbb N$ such that $[n]$ has the same cardinality as $X$. This means there is an invertible $\alpha : [n] \rightarrow X$.

To show that that two sets have the same cardinality:
1. Construct a function that maps one set to the other.
2. Find the inverse function.
3. Prove that its the inverse.

Remark that both the set $\Bbb N$ and $\Bbb Z$ have the *same* cardinality because we can find an invertible function $h: \Bbb N \rightarrow \Bbb Z$. Intuitively this means that $\Bbb N$ and $\Bbb Z$ are "equally infinite". The sets for which $\Bbb N$ is suffice to count the elements of a set are called *[[countable sets]]*.
