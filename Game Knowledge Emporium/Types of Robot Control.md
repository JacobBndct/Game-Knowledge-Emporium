Because of the many directions [[robotics]] took in it's early days, a method of organizing the different way robots are controlled was needed. The different types of robot controls of this age are called:

1. [[Reactive Control]]
2. [[hybrid control]]
3. [[behavior-based control]]

These are now called *purely deliberative control* and are no longer used in modern day robotics.
