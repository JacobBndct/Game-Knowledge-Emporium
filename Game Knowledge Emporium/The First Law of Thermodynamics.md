The total internal energy $E$ of such a system is the addition of the kinetic energy of all particles, plus still other components such as vibrational and rotational energy.

This energy $E$ depends on the state of the gas, that is on $P$, $V$ and $T$:
$E$ is a function of state.

Two out of three ($T$ and $V$, or $T$ and $P$, or $V$ and $P$) is enough for a full description (the third follows). Take $V$ and $T$
$$E = f(T)$$
The total energy $E$ of such a system is the addition of the kinetic energy of all particles, plus other components like vibrational- and rotational energy.
$$E = \sum({1 \over 2}mv^2_{i,c}$$
