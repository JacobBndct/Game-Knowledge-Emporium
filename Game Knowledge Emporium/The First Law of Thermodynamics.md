The total internal energy $E$ of such a system is the addition of the kinetic energy of all particles, plus still other components such as vibrational and rotational energy.

This energy $E$ depends on the state of the gas, that is on $P$, $V$ and $T$:
$E$ is a function of state.

Two out of three ($T$ and $V$, or $T$ and $P$, or $V$ and $P$) is enough for a full description (the third follows). Take $V$ and $T$
$$E = f(T)$$
The total energy $E$ of such a system is the addition of the kinetic energy of all particles, plus other components like vibrational- and rotational energy.

Simplest perfect gas: a 1-atomic gas (for example a noble gas). Then we get:
$$E = \sum({1 \over 2}mv^2_{i,x} + {1 \over 2}mv^2_{i,y} + {1 \over 2}mv^2_{i,z})$$
The average speed of the particles depend only on the temperature, in a surprisingly easy way: For a perfect gas:
$$E(t) = {3 \over 2}NkT$$

Energy conservation law for a complex mixture with a huge number of particles

Valid for a perfectly isolated system: $E$ is constant

For a closed, but not isolated system $E$ can change by:
- [[Work]] (W)
- [[Heat]] (Q)
### The first law: $\Delta E = W + Q$
All forms of work are equivalent
Heat, too, is measured with the same unit (Joule).

Normally, in the transition form a state $E_1$ to another state $E_2$ heat and work are not constant. Therefore the first law in its infinitesimal form:
$$dE =$$
