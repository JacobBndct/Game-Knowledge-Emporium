*Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are sets. If $X \subseteq Y$ and $Y \subseteq X$ then $X = Y$*

*Proof:* By definition of equality of sets we need to demonstrate two things:

1. For any $x \in X$: is also an element of $Y$
2. For any $y \in Y$: is also an element of $X$

By assumption we know X is a subset of Y so every x e X is also an element of Y. which proves 1.By assumption we also know that if y e Y then y e X so 2. holds. Since both 1. and 2. hold the proof is complete :)
