*Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are sets. If $X \subseteq Y$ and $Y \subseteq X$ then $X = Y$*

*Proof:* 
To show that X = Y we need to check two statements:
1.  For any x in X: if x e X than x e Y
2. For any y in Y: if y e Y than y e X

By assumption we know X is a subset of Y so every x e X is also an element of Y. which proves 1.By assumption we also know that if y e Y then y e X so 2. holds. Since both 1. and 2. hold the proof is complete :)
