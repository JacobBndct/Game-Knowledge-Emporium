***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- How can my players earn money? Should there be other ways?
- What can my players buy? Why?
- Is money too easy to get? Too hard? How can I change this?
- Are choices about earning and spending meaningful ones?
- Is a universal currency a good idea in my game o should there be specialized currencies?
