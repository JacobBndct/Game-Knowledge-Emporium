## ***Don't think, react!!!***

- Planning component (complex computation) is removed to get fast responses
- Reactive control uses a direct mapping between sensors and effectors
- A set of reactive rules couple specific situations to specific actions
- Reactive rules are similar to reflexes
- Reactive control is commonly used in dynamic environments
- It is based between tight coupling between sensors and actuators (and effectors)
- The robot reacts to the current sensory information and operate on a short time scale

## Action Selection
- In situations where multiple actions are triggered, action selection is needed
- Command arbitration
	- Select one action from multiple candidates
- Command fusion 
	- Combine multiple candidates into a single output action/behaviour
