One of the 3 requirements for [[Game Feel]] according to Steve Swink. 

Real-time control is a special type of interactivity between a computer and a person in a closed loop. 

The user has some intent which is expressed as an input to the computer and the computer then returns an output based on it's own internal logic which completes the closed loop. The player makes adjustments based on the perceived output. If the result of the output is perceived in the same moment it's expressed and the feedback loop is not broken, then the player feels the basis of game feel: precise, continuous control over a moving avatar.
