***Definitions***: Always true.

***Theorem***: Important statements
  
***Lemma***: Less important / auxiliary statements.

***Proofs***: A proof is a sequence of statements starting at accepted definitions & lemmas ending at S. Every step should be small and logical.

***Range***: The range of f : x -> y is f(x)

***Domain***: f : **X** -> Y

***Codomain***: f : X -> **Y**

## Metric and Topological Spaces

***Supremum***: least element in partially ordered set P which is greater than or equal to each element of S which is a subset of P.

***infimum***: greatest element in partially ordered set P which is less than or equal to each element of S which is a subset of P.
