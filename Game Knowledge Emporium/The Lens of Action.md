#### ***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What are the basic actions in my game?
- What are the strategic actions?
- What strategic actions would I like to see? How can I change my game in order to make those possible?
- Am I happy with the ratio of strategic to basic actions?
- What actions do players wish they could do in my game that they cannot? Can I somehow enable these, either as basic or strategic actions?
