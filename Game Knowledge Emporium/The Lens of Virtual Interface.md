#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- What information does a player need that isn't obvious just by looking at the game world?
- When does the player need this information?
- How can this information be delivered to the player in a way that won't interfere with the player's interactions with the game world?
- Are there elements of the game world that are easier using a virtual interface (like a popup menu) than direct interaction?
- What kind of virtual interface is best suited to my physical interface?
