#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- How is my world simpler than the real world? Can it be simpler in other ways?
- What kind of transcendent power do I give to the player? How can I give them even more without removing challenge from the game?
- Is my contribution of simplicity and transcendence contrived, or does it provide my players with a special kind of wish fulfillment.
