Genetic algorithms usually take two parents individuals and they recombine their genetic material to produce a child that inherits genetic material from both parents.

If the child performs well on the evaluation test (evaluating an individual and measuring how well an individual performs is commonly done by the use of a fitness function), it will also be selected for reproduction and in this way the genetic material can again be propagated to new generations. Since the individuals themselves will usually die (they are often replaced by individuals of the next generation), Richard Dawkins came with the selfish gene hypothesis. This hypothesis says that basically the genes are alive and use the mortal individuals (e.g. us) as hosts so that they are able to propagate themselves further. Some genes may be found in many individuals whereas other genes are only found in a small subset of individuals. In this way, the genes seem to compete for hosts, and genes which occupy well performing individuals are likely to be able to reproduce themselves. The other way around we can say that genes which occupy well performing individuals give advantages for the individual and therefore it is good if they are allowed to reproduce.
