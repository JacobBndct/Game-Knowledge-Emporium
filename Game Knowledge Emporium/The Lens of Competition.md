***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Does my game give a fair measurement of player skill?
- Do people want to win my game? Why?
- Is winning this game something people can be proud of? Why?
- Can novice meaningfully compete at my game?
- Can experts meaningfully compete at my game?
- Can experts generally be sure they will defeat novices?
