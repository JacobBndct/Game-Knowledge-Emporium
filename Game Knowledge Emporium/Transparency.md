The ideal interface becomes invisible to the player letting the player's imagination be completely immersed in the game world.
#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- Does the interface let the players do what they want?
- Do new players find the interface intuitive?
- Can players learn to use it without thinking?
- Can players continue to use the interface during stressful situations?
- Does something confuse players about the interface? On which of the six interface arrows is it happening?
- Do players feel a sense of immersion when using the interface?
