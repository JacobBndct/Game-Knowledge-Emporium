#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- What modes do I need in my game? Why?
- Can any modes be collapsed or combined?
- Are any of the modes overlapping? If so, can I put them on different input channels?
- When the game changes modes, how does the player know that? Can the game communicate the mode change in more than one way?
