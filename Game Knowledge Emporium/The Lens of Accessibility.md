***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- How will players know how to begin solving my puzzle, or playing my game? Do I need to explain it, or is it self-evident?
- Does my puzzle or game act like something they have seen before? If it does, how can I draw attention to that similarity? If it does not, how can I make them understand how it behaves?
- Does my puzzle or game draw people in, and make them want to touch it and manipulate it? If not, how can I change it so that it does?
