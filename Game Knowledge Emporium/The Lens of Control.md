#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- When players use the interface, does it do what they expected? If not, why not?
- Intuitive interfaces give a feeling of control. Is my interface easy to master, or hard to master?
- Do my players feel they have a strong influence over the outcome of the game? If not how can I change that?
- Feeling powerful = feeling in control. Do my players feel powerful? Can I make them feel more powerful somehow?
