*The elements of $X^{\Bbb N}$ are called (infinite) sequences. If $n \in \Bbb N$ then the elements of $X^{[n]}$ are called sequences of length $n$. For sequences the following alternative notations are used: $f(j) = f_j$ and $f \in X^{[n]}$ is alternatively described by listing its function values in order: $(f_0, f_1, \dots, f_{n-1})$.*
