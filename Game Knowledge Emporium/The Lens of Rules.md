***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What are the foundational rules of my game? How do these differ from the operational rules?
- Are there "laws" or "house rules" that are forming as the game develops? Should these be incorporated into my game directly?
- Are there different modes in my game? Do they make things simpler, or more complex? Would the game be better with more or less modes?
- Who enforces the rules?
- Are the rules easy to understand, or are they confusing? If confusing, should I change the rules or explain them more clearly?
