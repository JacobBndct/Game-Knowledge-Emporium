***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What rewards is my game giving out now? Can it give out others as well?
- Are players excited when they get rewards in my game, or are they bored by them? Why?
- Getting a reward you don't understand is like getting no reward at all. Do my players understand their rewards?
- Are the rewards my game gives out too regular? Can they be given out in a more variable way?
- How are my rewards related to one another? Is there a way they could be better connected?
- How are my rewards building? Too fast, too slow, just right?
