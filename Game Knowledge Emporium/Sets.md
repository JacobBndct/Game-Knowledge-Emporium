A **set** is a collection of objects. Those objects are called the **[[Elements]]** of the set. To say that some $x$ is an element of a set $X$ we often use the shorthand $x \in X$ and likewise $x \notin X$ means that $x$ is not an element of $X$.

Sets provide a language for grouping and organizing objects in mathematics. Sets and set notation are useful for streamlining reasoning and demonstrations in the form of clear statements and proofs. 
### Properties of sets:
1. Sets have no order
2. Can be infinite
3. [[Transitivity of inclusion]]
### Special sets:
1. [[Empty set]]
2. [[Power set]]
3. The set of [[natural numbers]]: $\Bbb N = \{0,1,2,3,\dots\}$
4. The set of [[integers]]: $\Bbb Z = \{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\dots\}$
5. The set of [[rational numbers]] (fractions): $\Bbb Q$
6. The set of [[real numbers]]: $\Bbb R$

The set of ordered pairs of real numbers $(x, y)$ is called $\Bbb R^2$ and is usually interpreted as coordinates of points in the plane. Similarly the set of ordered triples of real numbers $(x,y,z)$is called $\Bbb R^3$ and is used to describe three-dimensional space. 

### Types of sets:
1. [[Finite sets]]
2. [[Countable Sets]]
### Applications of sets
Sets are not only studied for their own sake, because of their nature they are used as building blocks for more complex mathematical constructs as well. A couple examples are listed below:
1. [[Graphs]]
