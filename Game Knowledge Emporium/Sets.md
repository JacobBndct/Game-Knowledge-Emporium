A **set** is a collection of objects. Those objects are called the **[[Elements]]** of the set. To say that some $x$ is an element of a set $X$ we often use the shorthand $x \in X$ and likewise $x \notin X$

Sets provide a language for grouping and organizing objects in mathematics. Sets and set notation are useful for streamlining reasoning and demonstrations in the form of clear statements and proofs. 

Properties of sets:
1. Sets have no order
2. Can be finite or infinite
