A **set** is a collection of objects. Those objects are called the **[[elements]]** of the set. To say that some $x$ is an element of a set $X$ we often use the shorthand $x \in X$ and likewise $x \notin X$ means that $x$ is not an element of $X$.

Sets provide a language for grouping and organizing objects in mathematics. Sets and set notation are useful for streamlining reasoning and demonstrations in the form of clear statements and proofs. 

Properties of sets:
1. Sets have no order
2. Can be finite or infinite

Special sets:
1. [[Empty set]]
2. [[Power set]]
3. The set of [[natural numbers]]: $\Bbb N = \{0,1,2,3,\dots\}$
4. The set of [[integers]]: $\Bbb Z = \{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\dots\}$
5. The set of [[rational numbers]] (fractions): $\Bbb Q$
6. The set of [[real numbers]]: $\Bbb R$
7. The of ordered pairs of real numbers (x, y)
