#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- Ideally, what would I like the players to do?
- Can constraints get players to do it?
- Can goals get the players to do it?
- Can interface get the players to do it?
- Can visual design get players to do it?
- Can game characters get players to do it?
- Can music or sound get players to do it?
- Is there some other method I can use to coerce players towards ideal behavior without impinging on their feeling of freedom?
