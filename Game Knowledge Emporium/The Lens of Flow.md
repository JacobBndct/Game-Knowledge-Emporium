***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?
- Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?
- Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?
- Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?
- Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?
