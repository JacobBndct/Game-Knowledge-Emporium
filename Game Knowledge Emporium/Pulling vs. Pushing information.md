### Pushing information
This is when the game forces information onto the player such as in a cutscene. The player is not necessarily ready to receive this information and may not absorb the information correctly. If too much information is forced onto the player then the player may feel overwhelmed.

### Pulling information
This is when the player does an action to signal that they want to receive the information. This can be something like talking to an NPC or interacting with the environment. One of the challenges to getting the player to pull information is signaling to the player that there is information that they can pull to prevent them from missing key information.
