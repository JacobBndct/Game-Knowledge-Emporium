***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What is the ultimate goal of my game?
- Is that goal clear to players?
- If there are a series of goals, do the players understand that?
- Are the different goals related to each other in a meaningful way?
- Are my goals concrete, achievable and rewarding?
- Do I have a good balance of short and long term goals?
- Do players have a chance to decide their own goals?
