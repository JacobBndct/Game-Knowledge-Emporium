***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What is the actual chance of a certain event occurring?
- What is the perceived change?
- What value does the outcome of that event have? Can the value be quantified? Are there intangible aspects of value that I am not considering?
- Each action a player can take has a different expected value. Am I happy with these values?
