Change who has what information, and you change your game completely. To use this lens, think about who knows what and why.

***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What is known by the game only?
- What is known by all players?
- What is known by some or only one player?
- Would changing who knows what information improve my game in some way?
