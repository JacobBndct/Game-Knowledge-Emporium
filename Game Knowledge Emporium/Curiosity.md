Visually striking moments help to drive player's initial curiosity and peak their interest and investment into the mystery. A good example for this is how Outer Wilds does this.

[[Pulling vs. Pushing information]]

Ask what are the player's true motivations and why they want to achieve them - not simply what the goals of your game are.

***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- What Questions does my game put into the player's mind?
- What am I doing to make them care about these questions?
- What can I do to make them invent even more questions?
