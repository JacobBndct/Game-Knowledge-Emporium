#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- Within the context of the game, who is the player helping?
- Can I make the player feel more connected to the characters who need help?
- Can I better tell the story of how meeting game goals helps someone?
- How can the helped character show their appreciation?
