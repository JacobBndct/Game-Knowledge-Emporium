You can think of functions as manipulations rather than simply mapping one value to another as it is usually described in high school

The composition of two functions f and g is called *g* o *f*. It is a function from domain of f to codomain provided domain(g) = codomain(f)

*g* o *f* : X -> Z is defined by (*g* o *f*)(x) = g(f(x))

Definition: two sets, X and Y, have equal cardinality if there exists an invertible f : X -> Y

X is called finite if there exists an n e Naturals and an invertible function f : \[n] -> X

X is countably infinite if there is an invertible f : natural numbers -> X

Theorem: There exists sets that are not countable. *Section 4*
