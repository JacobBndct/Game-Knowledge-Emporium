You can think of functions as manipulations rather than simply mapping one value to another as it is usually described in high school

To show that that two sets have the same cardinality construct a function that maps one set to the other and find the inverse function and prove that its the inverse.

Cantor Theorem: There exists sets that are not countable. *Section 4*

Composition of functions are associative. For example: ((h o g) o f)(x) == (h o (g o f))
