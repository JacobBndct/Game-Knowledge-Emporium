You can think of functions as manipulations rather than simply mapping one value to another as it is usually described in high school

The composition of two functions f and g is called *g* o *f*. It is a function from domain of f to codomain provided domain(g) = codomain(f)

Cardinality of a set is the number of elements in that set

$$ g o f : X \to Z is defined by (*g* o *f*)(x) = g(f(x)) $$

Definition: two sets, X and Y, have equal cardinality if there exists an invertible f : X -> Y

To show that that two sets have the same cardinality construct a function that maps one set to the other and find the inverse function and prove that its the inverse.

X is called finite if there exists an n e Naturals and an invertible function f : \[n] -> X

X is countably infinite if there is an invertible f : natural numbers -> X

Cantor Theorem: There exists sets that are not countable. *Section 4*

Composition of functions are associative. For example: ((h o g) o f)(x) == (h o (g o f))
