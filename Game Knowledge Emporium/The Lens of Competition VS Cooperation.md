***A Lens in the Book of lenses that asks the designer to consider:***
- If "1" is Competition and "10" is Cooperation, what number should my game get?
- Can I give players a choice whether to play cooperatively or competitively?
- Does my audience prefer competition, cooperation, or a mix?
- Is my team competition something that makes sense for my game? Is my game more fun with team competition, or with solo competition?
