#### ***A Lens in the Book of Lenses that Asks the Designer to consider:***
- What is there in my game that players can relate to? What else can I add?
- What is there in my game that will capture the players' imagination? What else can I add?
- Are there places in the game the players have always wanted to visit?
- Are there other characters in the game that the players would be interested to meet (or spy on)?
- Do the players get to do things that they would like to do in real life, but can't?
- Is there any activity in the game that once a player starts doing, it is hard to stop?
